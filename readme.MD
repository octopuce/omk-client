Roadmap:

# Methods to recover from blocked states
    -> UX
    -> MEthod
# Handling one or many transcoders is not really efficient or practical at this point
    -> better UX
    -> better code handling
# OMK_Result Handle results through a class. The current implementation is obscure and error prone 
    -> Code refactoring
# Uploader Adapter : protocol and adapter name are a bit mixed up, this should be clearer
    -> Code refactoring
# Media object / File object

# View rendering
    - Move to a real controller
